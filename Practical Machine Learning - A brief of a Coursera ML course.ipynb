    "If almost all the questions (especially the 4th) are True, this notebook is for you! \n",

    "Basically take this brief as a videogame. Just think you have a goal (let's say 'find the treasure') and there are several approaches to achive it. Depending on your experience, cleverness and tools, you will able to reach your goals faster and easier. But if not, at least you will get the experience to try it again with the next chance. \n",

    "3. *Features* -> \"Which info are definitively clues to reach the money, and which of them are prescindible?\"\n",
    "4. *Algorithm* -> \"Run the path that looks the best in our map, to reach the money/treasure!\"\n",
    "5. *Evaluation* -> \"Was it the result at the end of the path, that one we expected?(the money?) if not, what did we do wrong? can we try again? So let's try another path, or changing the weight of the clues, or getting more clues...\"\n",

The package contains dot product primitives (kernels), implementations of support vector machines and the relevance vector machine, Gaussian processes, a ranking algorithm, kernel PCA, kernel CCA, kernel feature analysis, online kernel methods and a spectral clustering algorithm. Moreover it provides a general purpose quadratic programming solver, and an incomplete Cholesky decomposition method.\n",
